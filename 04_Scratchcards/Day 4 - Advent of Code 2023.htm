Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not a massive company, and I can
only take so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, social media), I
built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and all
of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; preparing a new calendar and a new set of
puzzles each year takes all of my free time for 4-5 months. A lot of effort
went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl@hachyderm.io on Mastodon and
@ericwastl on Twitter.

- Eric Wastl

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 4: Scratchcards ---</h2><p>The 
gondola takes you up. Strangely, though, the ground doesn't seem to be 
coming with you; you're not climbing a mountain. As the circle of Snow 
Island recedes below you, an entire new landmass suddenly appears above 
you! The gondola carries you to the surface of the new island and 
lurches into the station.</p>
<p>As you exit the gondola, the first thing you notice is that the air here is much <em>warmer</em> than it was on Snow Island. It's also quite <em>humid</em>. Is this where the water source is?</p>
<p>The next thing you notice is an Elf sitting on the floor across the station in what seems to be a pile of colorful square cards.</p>
<p>"Oh! Hello!" The Elf excitedly runs over to you. "How may I be of service?" You ask about water sources.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure; I just operate the gondola lift. That does sound like something we'd have, though - this is <em><span title="I find this way funnier than it has any right to be.">Island Island</span></em>, after all! I bet the <em>gardener</em>
 would know. He's on a different island, though - er, the small kind 
surrounded by water, not the floating kind. We really need to come up 
with a better naming scheme. Tell you what: if you can help me with 
something quick, I'll let you <em>borrow my boat</em> and you can go visit the gardener. I got all these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratchcard" target="_blank">scratchcards</a> as a gift, but I can't figure out what I've won."</p>
<p>The Elf leads you over to the pile of colorful cards. There, you 
discover dozens of scratchcards, all with their opaque covering already 
scratched off. Picking one up, it looks like each card has two lists of 
numbers separated by a vertical bar (<code>|</code>): a list of <em>winning numbers</em> and then a list of <em>numbers you have</em>. You organize the information into a table (your puzzle input).</p>
<p>As far as the Elf has been able to figure out, you have to figure out which of the <em>numbers you have</em> appear in the list of <em>winning numbers</em>. The first match makes the card worth <em>one point</em> and each match after the first <em>doubles</em> the point value of that card.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53
Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19
Card 3:  1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14  1
Card 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58  5 54 83
Card 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36
Card 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, card 1 has five winning numbers (<code>41</code>, <code>48</code>, <code>83</code>, <code>86</code>, and <code>17</code>) and eight numbers you have (<code>83</code>, <code>86</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>31</code>, <code>17</code>, <code>9</code>, <code>48</code>, and <code>53</code>). Of the numbers you have, four of them (<code>48</code>, <code>83</code>, <code>17</code>, and <code>86</code>) are winning numbers! That means card 1 is worth <code><em>8</em></code> points (1 for the first match, then doubled three times for each of the three matches after the first).</p>
<ul>
<li>Card 2 has two winning numbers (<code>32</code> and <code>61</code>), so it is worth <code><em>2</em></code> points.</li>
<li>Card 3 has two winning numbers (<code>1</code> and <code>21</code>), so it is worth <code><em>2</em></code> points.</li>
<li>Card 4 has one winning number (<code>84</code>), so it is worth <code><em>1</em></code> point.</li>
<li>Card 5 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points.</li>
<li>Card 6 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in this example, the Elf's pile of scratchcards is worth <code><em>13</em></code> points.</p>
<p>Take a seat in the large pile of colorful cards. <em>How many points are they worth in total?</em></p>
